I am a Post-Doc researcher at Utrecht University School of Economics.

I finished a PhD in Economics from Cornell University in March 2022. 

My research interests include Development Economics and Labor Economics, specifically around the constraints and the incentives of human capital developments in developing countries. Geographically, my work has been concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa.

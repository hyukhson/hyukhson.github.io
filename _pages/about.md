I am a Post-Docotral researcher at Utrecht University School of Economics.

My research areas include Development Economics, Labor Economics and risk management strategies, specifically around the human capital developments and risk management strategies in low-income settings.

Prior to joining Utrecht University, I received my PhD in Economics from Cornell University in 2022. 

I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market.

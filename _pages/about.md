I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the College of Professional Studies at Northeastern University.

My research spans two complementary areas:
1. Human capital formation, including how education policies and labor market conditions shape the well-being and choices of children and youth in low-income settings.
2. How households manage risk and uncertainty -- particularly from climate shocks like droughts -- through financial innovations.

Across both areas, I use field experiments and impact evaluations to understand and inform policies that promote welfare and resilience in vulnerable communities.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Cornell University and previously worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher at Utrecht University.
